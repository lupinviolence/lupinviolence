You can call me <em>Toasty</em> or <strong>Shuji</strong>, as I use those most. <ins>Seraph</ins> and <ins>Masozi</ins> are also some names I use.

  I use he/him and ey/em pronouns. I don't mind they/them but I don't prefer it.

 When I have any sort of DNI on PT, c+h is still allowed! I don't bite. I'm afk/offtab often so you may whisper if you want to make sure I don't miss your message!
